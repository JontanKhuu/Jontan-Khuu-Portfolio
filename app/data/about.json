  "title": "About Me",
  "intro": "As a recent Computer Science graduate from SUNY University at Buffalo, I cultivated a strong foundation in software engineering through both rigorous coursework and hands-on experiences. My time at university, marked by valuable learning opportunities, allowed me to apply my skills in hackathons and diverse non-academic projects.\n\n\nI am resolutely committed to a career path characterized by perpetual learning and the strategic expansion of my intellectual capital within my areas of professional interest. This involves a deliberate and sustained investment of my time and intellectual effort into rigorous study, hands-on application, and staying abreast of emerging trends, all geared towards solidifying my understanding and elevating my capabilities.",
